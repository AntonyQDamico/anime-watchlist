## General info

Codecademy Project 'Open-Ended PERN App'
The prompt for this project is to create your own full-stck web app as a final project.

I took this project to make a watchlist that keeps track of each episode you need to watch in a list of shows. It also stores information about each show like what episode is next in your queue to watch, what is the next episode to add on your watchlist, where the show airs, what day the show airs, and how many episodes there are in total. This project works best to keep up to date when watching shows that are currently airing on a regular basis. Shows can be sorted by title to easily find a specific show, or can be sorted by air day to easily find shows airing on a specific weekday.

### Project Goals

1. Create a front-end using React.js
2. Create a server using Node.js, Express.js
3. Use a PostgreSQL database to store your data
4. Set up proper security

6. Deploy the web app on Heroku
